History   7B   Oral   History   Assignment
Fall   2024
For this assignment, you will conduct an   interview   of   a   resident   of the   United   States   about   their   historical experiences.    This   person could   be a   relative, friend,   instructor, or   colleague.      The   interviewee should   have   lived   in the   United States for several years.    They   do   not   need   to   be   a   U.S.   citizen.
What   Is The   Purpose of This Assignment?
Historians   use   many different types of   primary sources to   understand the   past.      Oral   histories   are   an   important way to capture the experiences of   individuals   and the   cultures   in   which   they   are embedded.    In this assignment, you will   interview   someone   who   lives   in   the   US   in   order   to understand what   life   has   been   like for them.    You will then write   up the   interview,   and try to   place   the   interviewee’s experiences   in the   larger context of   U.S.   history.    This will   help you   to   deepen   your   understanding of   both the   individual   and of   U.S.   history.
Finding a   Person to   Interview
You will want to choose a subject   who   will   have   interesting things   to   say,   and   to   develop   questions   that will   bring out those   points   in which you are   interested.
If appropriate,   I   highly   recommend   interviewing a   member of your family.    An   interview   such   as this   can   be a great opportunity to   learn   more about your   own   history,   as   well   as   U.S.   history.
After you   have chosen your   interviewee, you will   need to ask   permission to   conduct   the   interview.      Let the   interviewee   know that this   is for a class assignment,   and   that   you   will   be   writing   an   essay   to turn   in to your   professor.    The   interview will   not   be   published or shared elsewhere;   only   your   professor will   read   it.    If you want to   record your   interview,   please   be   sure   to   ask   permission   of your interviewee   in advance   (if they don’t give   permission, don’t   record).      Set   up   an   appointment for   the interview, and   be sure to show   up on time.      Your   interview   will   probably   take   at   least   an   hour   of   your   subject’s time, depending on your   questions.
If you   have difficulty finding someone to   interview,   please   let   me   know.
Developing Questions
Your goal   in the   interview   is to deepen your   understanding of   U.S.   history   by getting   a   personal   perspective on   historical events.    Your   interview questions should therefore   focus   on   both   the   personal and the   historical. Generally, you want to   keep your   questions fairly   broad,   so   that   your   subject will   be able to answer fully.    Avoid yes/no   questions.
Your questions should   be focused   primarily on   understanding   how your   interviewee   has experienced   historical events over the course   of their   lifetime.
Your first questions should establish   basic   personal   information about your   subject.      You   should   ask   about demographic   background,   level of education, where the subject   was   born   and   raised,   family         background   (economic class,   number of siblings,   parents’   profession and   level of   education)   etc.
Then, ask questions about their experiences   with   historical   events   and trends.
Below are some suggestions for question topics.      Please   note   that   some   of   these   questions   are   personal or sensitive; they   may   not   be appropriate for   a   person you   do   not   know   well.      In   addition,   if   your subject does   not want to answer   a   particular   question,   respect that.
•            Heritage from ancestors, and   how that   has shaped their   lives
•            Raising a family,   if   relevant
•            Military service
•            Experiences around   race and ethnicity.
•            Impact of   religion on the   subject’s   life
•            If   relevant,   impact of   immigration
•            Questions   particular to the specific
community to which your subject   belongs
•            Impact of global events:      World   War   II,
Vietnam, the Cold War, the   Gulf War,   etc.
•            Participation   in   political events or   parties
•            Participation   in or   perspectives on social   movements, such as the   Civil   Rights
Movement, women’s   rights   movement,   queer   rights   movement, etc.
•            Changes   in technology   over the course   of   the subject’s   life.
•            Changes   in women’s   roles observed   in the   subject’s   lifetime
•            Changes   in social values or   norms   over   the course of the   subject’s   life.
•            Subject’s opinion of various   presidents,   governors,   political   parties, etc.
•            Changes   in   pop culture   (radio, TV,   music)   over the course of the   subject’s   life
•            Differences   between   how young   people
live today and   how they   lived “back   in the   day”
Conducting the   InterviewBefore the   interview   begins,   be sure to   have your subject sign the   release form   attached.   Also   take   time to set   up    your   recording equipment,   if you are   using   it   (be   sure your   batteries   are   charged   in      advance).    Even   if you do   record, you should   take   handwritten   notes,   in   case   your   tech   crashes.
Please aware that you   may   be asking some   personal, controversial   and   difficult   questions.      Please   be   sensitive to your subject, and   be 代 写History 7B Oral History Assignment Fall 2024Matlab
代做程序编程语言aware that things   you   think   are   straightforward   may   not   be.      Avoid      loaded questions   (“feminism   is stupid,   isn’t   it?”) and save your   most   controversial   questions for   the         end of the   interview, so that the subject   has   had time to   become   comfortable   with   you.      Also, monitor your own   responses to questions, and   be   careful   of your   body   language   and facial   expression to   be sure you   remain   neutral.    Your   purpose   here   is to collect   information and   to   learn   from another   person’s   perspective,   not to judge your subject.
Remember at all times to   be   respectful,   polite and   objective.    This   interview   is   about your   subject,   not you.    Remember that your subject   has the   right   to   not   answer   any   questions   they   are   not comfortable with.
After the   interview, you should send a thank you   note to   your   subject,   thanking   them   for   their   time   and assistance.    You   might also share your write   up   of the   interview   with   them.
Researching Context
After you   have conducted the   interview, spend some time   researching the   historical   context   of the events they described.    For example,   if your   interviewee   participated   in   the   protests   in   Berkeley   in the   1960s, do a   bit of   research on the   history   of that   movement   to   understand   what   was   happening   in that community at that time.    Or,   if   your   subject   was   a   member   of   a   labor   union,   research   the history of that   union.
Research skills will   be taught during the course   of the   semester.
Writing   Up the   Interview
After you   have conducted the   interview and completed your   contextual   research, write   up   a   five   to   six   page essay   in which you   present the   results of the   interview.      In your   essay,   please   address the following three areas:
Your   Interviewee’s Story
•            Summarize the   main   points of the   interview.
•          What   about the   interview   surprised   or   intrigued you?      What   did   you   learn   that   you   didn’t   know   before?
The   Historical Context of Your   Interviewee’s Story
•          Place   the   events   of   your   subject’s   life   in   historical   context.      For   example,   if   your   subject   lived      in   Berkeley   in the 60s, give some   background on what   was   happening   in   Berkeley   during   that   period.
•          Consider   how   your   subject’s   life   fits   in   to   the   larger   context   of   women’s   history.      In   what   way   are the events of your   interviewee’s   life similar to   or   different from   other   events   of the period   in which they   lived?    How did the “big” trends   of   women’s   history   impact   your   interviewee’s   life?    How did your   interviewee   help to shape   history?   Or   were   these “big”   trends   not   relevant for your subject?
•          What   historical factors   shaped the   choices   and   decisions   that   your   interviewee   made   in   their   life?
•          Were the   experiences   of your   subject   typical   of their   times?      How   do   you   know   this?
•          How   do   the   experiences   of   an   individual   differ   from   the   experiences   of   a   generation   or   culture?
Pros and   Cons of   Oral   History
•          What   are the   benefits   and   pitfalls   of   oral   history   as   a   method   of   historical   research?

Outside sources   used to explain context   must   be either   primary   or   scholarly   secondary   sources.      Be   sure to document your sources   using Chicago-style. footnotes.      Be   sure to   include   a   bibliography   at      the end   of the   paper.
